C++ Telephone Directory

Author: Steve Robinson

This is a C++ based Telephone directory that uses a file to store and retrieve records. This code was written by me to try out object serialization features of C++. This code was untouched for several months and now Ive decided to opensource it so that C++ beginners can test their skills and work on this code. Its not the most effecient piece of code and its ridden with bugs. I want people to fix 'em.

A list of issues will be published shortly.
